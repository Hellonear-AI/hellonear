# CLAUDE.md — apps/landing

Landing page. Owner: Nabil. Issue: #10.

**Update this file in the same PR whenever you change setup, commands, the framework, deploy target, or copy guidelines.** Root rules in `/CLAUDE.md` also apply.

## Design

Use the tokens and rules in `/design` (`design/CLAUDE.md`): Stone & Lime colors, Geist, no gradients on UI elements, mono only for wallet addresses.

The landing design lives in `design/landing.pen` (frame `Landing v0.1`, plus the note `Hero interaction spec`), not in `hellonear.pen`, so landing and app-screen edits never conflict in one file. Its tokens are a copy of `hellonear.pen`'s; when those change, copy them over.

## Copy guidelines

- Problem: AI agents that hold money have no limits you can trust. Solution: a Mind whose wallet limits are stored on-chain and enforced in a TEE, with private, verifiable AI.
- Never claim "rejected on-chain"; say "policy stored on-chain, enforced in a TEE before signing".
- Only call inference "private" for NEAR AI Confidential TEE models.
- Money claims follow the #55 decisions: every payment asks the owner first; the per-payment limit and the address list are hard stops; there is no daily limit and no per-skill wallet (one wallet per Mind).
- Only name connected apps that work on `main`: Gmail today; Google Calendar is planned (#57).
- Do not copy HelloMinds/Animoca characters, names, or visual style.
- English only.
